# TheRandomWalk
I saw the Random Walk on a visit to the Henry Ford Museum. The premise is “A man a trifle tipsy, is leaning against a lamp post in the middle of a paved square. He sets out for home, but his impaired balance makes him stagger forwards, backwards, sideways and diagonally in an unpredictable way.”
